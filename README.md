# React Video Looper
A video component that provides non-destructive inner looping of a video source file.

## Intro
This component takes a video source file with two specified values (start and end points) and then generates a looping video element.

It offers an alternative to the default HTML5 video loop attribute allowing you to use the original video source file and benefit from performant non-destructive looping.

Under the hood this component utilises two overlapping video elements that playback in turn, which in many cases provides a more seamless loop experience compared to the default loop attribute or media fragments. Running the demo in debug mode illustrates this technique by highlighting the two video instances playing side by side.
